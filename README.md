# Problem

A newspaper editor was researching immigration data trends on H1B(H-1B, H-1B1, E-3) visa application processing over the past years, trying to identify the occupations and states with the most number of approved H1B visas. She has found statistics available from the US Department of Labor and its [Office of Foreign Labor Certification Performance Data](https://www.foreignlaborcert.doleta.gov/performancedata.cfm#dis). But while there are ready-made reports for [2018](https://www.foreignlaborcert.doleta.gov/pdf/PerformanceData/2018/H-1B_Selected_Statistics_FY2018_Q4.pdf) and [2017](https://www.foreignlaborcert.doleta.gov/pdf/PerformanceData/2017/H-1B_Selected_Statistics_FY2017.pdf), the site doesnâ€™t have them for past years. 

As a data engineer, you are asked to create a mechanism to analyze past years data, specificially calculate two metrics: **Top 10 Occupations** and **Top 10 States** for **certified** visa applications.

Your code should be modular and reusable for future. If the newspaper gets data for the year 2019 (with the assumption that the necessary data to calculate the metrics are available) and puts it in the `input` directory, running the `run.sh` script should produce the results in the `output` folder without needing to change the code.

# Approach

* read data 
* clean data: select columns needed, retain certified H1B data only
* calculate top 10 rank: 1. sum cases 2. rank top 10 records and output each record
* output data: output txt files

# Run instruction
* put input files inside input folder, then `bash run.sh`
* to run unittest, `python3 src/h1b_test.py`
